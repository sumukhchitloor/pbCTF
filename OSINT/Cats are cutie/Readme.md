There is a Github Username: `whyamihere`, on searching in GitHub we find a repository.

If you check the first commit of the repo, you find a link in the `href` of a tag

Paste that link in Google and you find a lot of cat photos.

You notice that there is one cat on the right that is focused and has a visit button below it.
Click the visit button and in the comments of the image you will find the flag.
