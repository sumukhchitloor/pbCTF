# Pigeon People

>Welcome, digital detectives, to the heart of Tokyo's urban jungle! Picture this: the rhythmic flutter of pigeons' wings, the hum of street life, and one vigilant observer capturing nature's nuances. Embark on a quest within an image of Tokyo's lively streets. One observer stands out among the crowdâ€”a sentinel of serenity amidst the urban rhythm. Shift your view to the left. A person, adorned in a colored hoodie, immortalizes plant life with a camera's lens, heavier than a pigeon and wearing purple shoes with pink ribbon in his pocket

>Your task is to find the color of the hoodie and answer the puzzle like pbCTF{color_hoodie}
 Eg: If it is a black hoodie then the flag will be pbCTF{black_hoodie}
